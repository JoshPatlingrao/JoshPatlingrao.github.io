            <h1>Hello, my name is Joshua Patlingrao</h1>

            <h3>Electrical and Electronic Engineer</h3>

            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's of Engineering Degree, who's very eager to gain industry
                experience and expand my expertise in both hardware and software aspects of electronics. With a passion
                for
                technology and a drive for continuous learning, I've applied and developed my ability to troubleshoot,
                repair, and upgrade electronic equipment at my place of employment, while I honed my Python scripting
                through my volunteer and personal projects. I'm an organized, capable junior engineer, who bring
                diligence and independence in my everyday life.
